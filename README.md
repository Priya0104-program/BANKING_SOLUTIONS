Here if they click on any button a the system will tell which button is clicked and what it does.
RED button is for moving to checking account details page.
GREEN button is for moving to tranfer page.
BLACK button is for moving to check balance page.
YELLOW button is for moving to transaction history page.
PURPLE button is for moving to logout page.

In this application i have used large coloured button so that they are able to differntiate.
